# AVL_Trees
Implemented AVL Trees for adding different objects in different bins via largest fit and compact fit algorithms.
Largest Fit ALgorithm:
When adding an object to a bin, this algorithm selects the bin with the largest remaining
capacity.
Compact Fit Algorithm:
When adding an object to a bin, this algorithm selects the bin with the smallest remaining
capacity that can accommodate this particular object.
Using AVL Trees to store the cargoes reduced the time complexity of adding the object to a bin according to the size to O(log n).
